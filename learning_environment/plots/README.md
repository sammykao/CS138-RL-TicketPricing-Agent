# Plots

This folder contains generated plots and visualizations.

## Contents

- **`paper_graphs/`**: Publication-quality plots for the research paper
  - `training_curves.png`: Learning curves (rewards, loss, epsilon, episode lengths)
  - `convergence_metrics.png`: Convergence analysis
  - `reward_distribution_by_phase.png`: Reward distributions across training phases
  - `sell_through_analysis.png`: Sell-through rate analysis
  - `episode_length_analysis.png`: Episode length patterns
  - `loss_analysis.png`: Training loss analysis
  - `epsilon_analysis.png`: Exploration-exploitation analysis

- **`demand_3d_price_prob_time_env.png`**: 3D surface showing sale probability as a function of price and time (using environment logic)

- **`demand_2d_slices_by_time_env.png`**: 2D slices of demand curves at different time points

- **`avg_sale_price_by_time.png`**: Average sale price trends over time

- **`quality_diagnosis.png`**: Quality tier analysis and price trends

- **`training_metrics.json`**: Raw training metrics data (used to generate paper graphs)

## Generation

Plots are generated by:
- **`generate_paper_graphs.py`**: Creates all paper graphs from training metrics
- **`generate_env_demand_graphs.py`**: Creates 3D demand surfaces using environment logic
